# Hypopituitarism

- Decreased secretion of anterior pituitary hormones.

### They are affected in the following order

- GH
- Gonadotropins
- FSH/LH
- Prolactin
- TSH
- ACTH

### Panhypopituitarism is a deficiency of all anterior hormones, caused by:

- Irradiation
- Surgery
- Tumour

### Causes

- Hypothalamus level (tumour, inflammation, infection, ischaemia)
- Pituitary Stalk level (Trauma, surgery, mass lesion, meningioma, aneursym)
- Pituitary Level (Tumour, irradiation, inflammation, autoimmunity, infiltration, ischaemia)

### Clinical Features

### GH Lack

- Central Obesity
- Atherosclerosis
- Decreased strength
- Dry skin
- Decreased balance
- Decreased exercise ability
- Decrased glucose

### FSH/LH lack

- Amenorrhoea
- Decreased fertility
- Decreased libido
- Osteoporosis
- Breast atrophy
- Dyspareunia

- Erectile dysfunction
- Decreased libido
- Decreased muscle bulk
- Hypogonadism

### TSH Lack

- Hypothyroidism

### Corticotrophin lack

- Addison's Disease

### Prolactin Lack

- Rare

### Investigations

- Basal Tests (Haematology)
- Dynamic Tests (Short Synacthen test, Insulin Tolerance Test, Glucagon stimulation test)

### Treatment

- Hormone Replacement (Hydrocortisone, Thyroxine, Testosterone, GH)
- Treatment of underlying cause

# Pituitary Tumour

- Almost always adenomas
- 10% of intracranial tumours

### Classification

- Microadenoma (<1cm) or Macroadenoma (>1cm)

Three histological types:

- Chromophobe (70%. Many are non-secretory, some cause hypopituitarism. 50% produce prolactin, few produce ACTH or GH. Local pressure effect in 30%)
- Acidophil (Secrete GH/Prolactin, local pressure effect in 10%)
- Basophil (Secrete ACTH, local pressure rare)

### Clinical Features

Symptoms are caused by pressure, hormones or hypopituitarism

- Headache
- Bitemporal Hemianopia
- Cranial Nerve Palsy III, IV, VI
- Diabetes Insipidus
- Disturbance of temperature, sleep and appetite

### Investigations

- MRI
- Basal Tests (Haematology)
- Dynamic Tests (Short Synacthen test, Insulin Tolerance Test, Glucagon stimulation test)

### Treatment

- Hormone Replacement if needed
- Surgery (Trans-sphenoidal usually)
- Radiotherapy

### Post-Op

- Recurrence may occur late so life long follow up is required


# Hyperprolactinaemia

Commonest hormonal disturbance of the pituitary. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary and release is inhibited by dopamine produced in the hypothalamus.

### Causes

Hyperprolactinaemia may result from:
1. Excess production
2. Disinhibition, by compression of the pituitary stalk
3. Use of a dopamine antagonist

#### Physiological

- Pregnancy
- Breastfeeding
- Stress

#### Drugs

- Metoclopromide
- Haloperidol
- Oestrogen
- MDMA
- Anti-psychotics

### Diseases

- Micro/Macroadenoma
- Stalk Damgage from adenomas, surgery, trauma
- Hypothalamic disease
- Hypothyroidism
- CKD

### Symptoms

- Amenorrhoea
- Decreased fertility
- Decreased libido
- Galactorrhoea

- Erectile dysfunction
- Decreased facial hair
- Galactorrhoea


### Management

- Dopamine agonists are 1st line
- Surgery if intolerant to therapy
- Surgery if visual symptoms/pressure effects from an adenoma

### Follow-up

- Monitor Prolactin
- If headache or visual loss, check fields
- Can reduce medications after 2 years, but recurrence may occur

### Acromegaly

- Due to increased secretion of growth hormone from a pituitary tumour or hyperplasia
- GH stimulates bone and soft tissue growth through IGF-1

### Symptoms

- Amenorrhoea
- Decreased libido
- HEadache
- Increased Sweating
- Snoring
- Things don't fit
- Putting on weight
- Wonky bite

### Signs

- Growth of hands, jaw and feet
- Coarsening of face, wide nose
- Large supraorbital ridges
- Macroglossia
- Widely spaced teeth
- Puffy lips, lids and skin
- Skin darkening
- Acanthosis Nigrans
- Laryngeal Dyspnoea
- Goitre
- Proximal weakness
- Arthropathy
- Carpal Tunnel
- Signs from a pituitary mass

### Investigations

- Glucose
- Calcium and Phosphate
- GH
- MRI of pituitary fossa
- Visual Fields
- Echo
- ECG
- Old photos

### Treatment

- Surgery first line
- Somatostatin analogues
- Radiotherapy
- GH antagonists

### Complications

- CCF
- Impaired glucose tolerance/DM
- Ketoacidosis
- HTN
- LVH
- Cardiomyopathy
- Arrthymias
- Increased IHD risk
- Increased Stroke risk
- Increased Colon Ca risk

### Prognosis

- May return to normal
- Additional vascular morbidity

# Diabetes Insipidus

Passage of large volumes of dilute urine due to impaired water resorption by the kidney, because of:

- reduced ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary

or

- impaired response of the kidney to ADH

### Classification

- Nephrogenic DI

- Cranial DI

### Symptoms

- Polyuria
- Polydipsia (uncontrollable and all consuming)
- Dehyrdration
- Symptoms of hypernatraemia

### Causes of Cranial DI

- Idiopathic
- Congenital
- Tumour (Mets, Pituitary Tumour, Craniopharyngioma)
- Trauma
- Infilration (Histiocytosis/Sarcoidosis)
- Vascular (Haemorrhage)

### Causes of Nephrogenic DI

- Inherited
- Metabolic (Low K+, High Calcium)
- Drugs (Lithium)
- Chronic Renal Disease
- Post-obstructive uropathy

### Investigations

- U+E
- Calcium
- Glucose
- Serum and Urine Abnormalities
- MRI

### Diagnosis

- 8 hour water deprivation test
- https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/Water%20Deprivation%20Test%20in%20Adults.pdf

### Treatment

### Cranial DI

- Find the cause
- Give desmopressin

### Nephrogenic DI

- Treat the cause
- Try bendroflumethiazide, NSAIDs
